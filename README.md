# Derrylin O'Connells GAC – fixtures, results and live scores

A mobile-first club website that:

- pulls every Derrylin O'Connells fixture and result (Seniors, Reserves, U18, U16, U14 …) from the
  [Fermanagh GAA team page](https://fermanagh.gaa.ie/fixtures-results/team/derrylin-oconnells/a78482ce-7649-6fcf-4908-5f2190e62840/),
  automatically, every 2 hours (every 30 minutes Friday to Sunday)
- adds any game to a phone calendar (Apple, Outlook or Google), or subscribes people to a calendar
  for all teams or one team that updates by itself
- gives one-tap directions to the venue in Google Maps
- has live scoring: club scorers tap **Point** (white flag), **2 points** (orange flag) or **Goal**
  (green flag) and everyone watching the site sees the score change straight away, no login needed
- lets admins add, promote and remove scorers from inside the site

It's free to run: GitHub Pages hosts the site, a GitHub Action refreshes the fixtures, and Firebase
(free Spark plan) stores live scores and logins.

## What's in the folder

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | The website. GitHub Pages serves this folder. |
| `docs/firebase-config.js` | Where you paste your Firebase settings (step 3). |
| `docs/data/fixtures.js` | Fixtures and results. Written by the scraper; don't edit by hand. |
| `docs/fixtures*.ics` | Calendar feeds people can subscribe to. Written by the scraper. |
| `scraper/scrape.py` | Reads the Fermanagh GAA team page and rebuilds the data and calendars. |
| `.github/workflows/refresh-fixtures.yml` | Runs the scraper on a schedule. |
| `firestore.rules` | Firebase security rules: who can score, who can manage scorers. |

## Setting it up (about 20 minutes, once)

### 1. Put it on GitHub

1. Use (or create) a **club** GitHub account so the web address doesn't show anyone's personal username.
2. Create a new repository, e.g. `derrylin-gaa`. Public is simplest.
3. Upload everything in this folder, keeping the folder structure, including the hidden `.github` folder.
   (Easiest: on the repo page choose **Add file > Upload files** and drag the whole folder contents in.)

### 2. Turn on the website and the fixtures refresh

1. Repo **Settings > Pages**: Source = **Deploy from a branch**, Branch = `main`, folder = `/docs`. Save.
   A minute later the site is live at `https://<club-account>.github.io/derrylin-gaa/`.
2. Repo **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions**: choose **Read and write permissions**. Save.
3. **Actions** tab: if asked, enable workflows. Open **Refresh fixtures** and press **Run workflow** once.
   It should finish green in under a minute. If it goes red, see *If the fixtures stop updating* below.

The site already works at this point in **demo mode**: fixtures, results, calendars and directions are
live, and live scoring can be tried out but is only saved on the phone doing it.

### 3. Connect Firebase so live scores are shared

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com), **Create a project**
   (e.g. `derrylin-gaa`). Google Analytics isn't needed.
2. **Build > Authentication > Get started > Sign-in method**: enable **Email/Password**.
3. **Build > Firestore Database > Create database**: location `europe-west2 (London)`, start in
   **production mode**.
4. In Firestore, open the **Rules** tab, replace everything with the contents of `firestore.rules`,
   and press **Publish**.
5. **Project settings** (cog icon) > **Your apps** > the `</>` web icon. Give it a name, skip hosting,
   and copy the `firebaseConfig` values into `docs/firebase-config.js` on GitHub (edit the file in the
   browser and commit).

### 4. Make yourself the owner (do this straight away)

1. Open the website and press **Scorer sign in** at the bottom.
2. Because nobody owns the site yet, it shows **Set up the site**. Enter your name, email and a password.
   You're now the owner: a permanent admin who can't be removed.

### 5. Add scorers

Signed in, press **Scorers** in the dark bar at the top. Enter a name and email and choose **Scorer**
or **Admin**. They get an email from Firebase with a link to choose their own password (tell them to
check spam). To take someone's access away, set them to **Removed**; you can restore them later.

## Scoring a game (for scorers)

1. Sign in, then press **Score live** on the game (it appears on the day of the game).
2. Tap **First half** at throw-in (or just start scoring; the first score starts the first half).
3. Each time an umpire raises a flag, tap the matching button under the right team:
   white = **Point**, orange = **2 points**, green = **Goal**.
4. Mis-tap? **Undo last score**, or **Remove** any score in the list underneath.
5. Tap **Half-time**, **Second half** and **Full-time** as the game goes on.

Scores are saved on the phone first, so poor signal at the pitch is fine: the page says
*Waiting for signal* and sends them by itself when the connection comes back. More than one scorer
can score the same game. Use **Share this game** to send the live link to a WhatsApp group.

**Add a game** (top bar) is for games that aren't on the Fermanagh GAA site: challenge matches, blitzes,
ladies games. They can be scored live the same way.

## Things worth knowing

- **Scores are shown the GAA way**, goals-points, where the points figure includes 2-pointers.
  1 goal, one 2-pointer and 3 single points is **1-5 (8)**.
- **Fermanagh GAA only lists the next few fixtures per club.** Later games appear as they publish them.
  Older results are kept once seen, so the Results tab builds up over the season.
- **Directions** use the venue name as Fermanagh GAA writes it. If one comes up wrong in Google Maps
  (usually an Irish-language ground name), add it to `VENUE_ALIASES` near the top of `docs/app.js`.
- After **2 hours past throw-in** a game moves from Fixtures to Results, showing the club scorer's score
  until the official result arrives.
- **Calendar subscriptions**: Apple and Outlook pick up changes within a few hours. Google Calendar
  can be slower.

## If the fixtures stop updating

Open the **Actions** tab and look at the latest **Refresh fixtures** run.

- **Red, "No Derrylin matches found"**: Fermanagh GAA changed their page layout or blocked the request.
  The site keeps showing the last good data. The parsing lives in `parse_team_page()` in
  `scraper/scrape.py`; `python scraper/test_parser.py` checks it.
- **Workflows disabled**: GitHub pauses scheduled jobs after 60 days with no repository activity
  (it can happen over the winter). Press **Enable workflow** on the Actions tab.
- To run it by hand at any time: **Actions > Refresh fixtures > Run workflow**.

## Running it on a computer (optional)

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
python scraper/scrape.py            # fetch from Fermanagh GAA and rebuild docs/data
cd docs && python -m http.server    # then open http://localhost:8000
```
